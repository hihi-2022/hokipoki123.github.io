    <h2>Being stuck on a simple problem</h2>
    <p>
      On the Manipulating JS objects I got a bit stuck with some assignments. I
      went over the error codes to find the places issues were happening and to
      change issues, I had been trying to reassign some values instead of just
      pushing them. I felt confused but not hopelessly lost like some other
      parts. I learnt how to better understand errors and what an error looks
      like if you miss an important bracket.
    </p>
    <h2>Elegantly solving a problem</h2>
    <p>
      The first part of the fizzbuzz challenge was quite an easy solve for me.
      You had to return a word instead of a number in some cases. So I made and
      if else function. When I wasn't sure about some parts I looked up other
      peoples solutions to see I had made a mistake in some syntax. The process
      felt good in the sense I felt like I knew what I was doing. I learned how
      to write and if else loop that returns words at certain points.
    </p>
    <h2>Confidence in problem solving</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>I am not confident in my ability to pseudocode as it feels more like a stream of conscience about something I don't really understand well. </li>
      <li>I am not afraid to try something but I don't expect to get much right initially.</li>
      <li>I'm not condident with the rubberducky method as even when I explain an issue to someone I will still not understand whats going wrong only where roughly it is going wrong.  </li>
      <li>Reading error messages is ok, but sometimes I can't see the exact error.</li>
      <li>Console logging I feel confident about as it allows me to read any bit im stuck to troubleshoot.</li>
      <li>Googling is ok, its not super fun trawling for you solution but it's nessesary.</li>
      <li>Asking peers for help is ok, however I'm not the best at explaining an issue.</li>
      <li>I suppose asking coaches for help isn't the biggest issue, however as I'm not the fastest I ussually look at their helping of others first.</li>
      <li>Whilst I struggle a bit I do try to mull over solutions in my head to understand them especially when I use someones elses solution as a guide.</li>
    </ol>
