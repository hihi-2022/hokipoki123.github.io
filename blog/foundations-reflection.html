    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Three things I have learnt about myself and my ego are firstly that I do
      not like not knowing things, I always want to try to understand things I
      learn about. I also have found out that I can feel guilty when I’m
      following other peoples examples and instructions, as if I should just
      understand better already. I have also learned how important it can be for
      me to manage my expectations and to take breaks when I’m frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The role of values empathy and self awareness has been important for
      understanding that neither me nor other people are perfect at this stuff
      and therefore we should all be given slack, even if it is hard to give
      yourself a break.
    </p>
    <p>
      What surprised me most about the core learning is how relevant it really
      is to the learning experience whether managing emotions or believing in
      your ability to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most challenging aspects of the core learning was putting it into
      practice. Even though I should meditate I often can’t be bothered or when
      judging my own work I have often been harsh on myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that dev academy focuses a lot on core learning because of how
      critical healthy self management and the ability to relate to others is in
      both life and the work place. So many places may leave out these aspects
      of learning but the benefit they provide are highly valuable. Also in
      learning the things that have been taught in the core learning we are more
      likely to succeed in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      No the time spent on the core learning does not feel wasted. When given
      the knowledge shared in the core segment you are more able to reflect on
      yourself and you learning which helps your learning. Also, for me at least
      it has felt necessary that this focus on self reflection and recognising
      ones own ability needs to be constantly reminded to me whenever I have
      felt negatively about my work.
