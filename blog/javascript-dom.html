    <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a programming language that is used to make interactive web
      content. JavaScript is a commonly used language because it is versatile
      and also because it is native to web browsers. JavaScript is also useful
      because it can interact with HTML and CSS. Where as HTML has the content
      and CSS makes things pretty, JavaScript makes things happen. An analogy
      could be HTML is the builder, CSS is the artist and JavaScript is the
      wizard.
    </p>
    <h2>Control flow and Loops</h2>
    <p>
      Control flow is a programs order of operations. It refers to the order in
      which parts of a script are executed so that an action is performed. It
      could be akin to waking up, driving to work, working. The order of
      operation must happen in a certain way, you couldn't drive to work before
      waking up for example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Loops are for executing some code multiple times until a certain value is
      met. They are useful for checking things repeatedly or just repeating a
      script. They are useful as they prevent the need to contantly write more
      code according to every new variable. They could be analogous to cooking,
      we check the food is cooked and if it is not we will check again until it
      is.

    <h2>The DOM</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM is the Document Object Model. The DOM is a programming interface
      that represents a webpage so that it can be modified. The DOM is like a
      signpost for JavaScript or other languages to allow access to all the
      elements that should be accessed. An example of how the DOM may be used is
      that someone could want to access classes stored in another page and use
      them for a function, which the DOM would facilitate.
    </p>
    <h2>Arrays vs Objects</h2>
    <p>
      An object is a item that one has created, they will have properties
      assigned to them. An array alternatively is like a list of items that are
      stored sequentially. Because of this difference the stored data of objects
      and arrays are accessed differently. To access the data from an object you
      use a key to retrieve date eg(someone.eyecolor). For an array you use the
      array position counted up from 0, for example if an array was (animal =
      ["tiger", "lion"]) you would call animal[1] to access the lion.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      A function is in essence and action or calculation that is taking place.
      It takes some data and does something with the data. These are helpful as
      they allow things to be done on a website, whether reacting to the user or
      generating something.
