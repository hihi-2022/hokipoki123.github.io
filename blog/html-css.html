        The Box Model is an important tool for design of web layout, it
        illustrates how an element may be situated on a page and how close it
        may be to others.
      </p>

      <p>
        When one looks at a picture of the template of an element from a website
        it can be very difficult to understand what is going on. I will
        therefore give an attempt at explanation.
      </p>

        The padding is the area immediately around the element that has been
        created. The job of the padding is to prevent the element whether image,
        text or other from coming into contact with anything else, notably the
        border. It is a transparent and simply creates more space between the
        element and the border.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone wanted to create padding it could be as simple as seen in the
        following image. In this case the padding has simply been made to have 5
        pixels of space either side. For border or margin you could just change
        the first world to border or margin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next part of the box is the border. The border alloys an element to
        be enclosed visually, making a user know exactly where the content of
        the element is kept. The border of course also allows for some artistic
        freedom as you may edit the colour, thickness and other features of the
        border.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last part I will talk about is the margin. The margin is the
        outer-most space of an element. This area surrounds the borders and has
        the important role of preventing elements from being to close to other
        elements or parts of a page. This is important for preventing elements
        from bleeding into one another.
