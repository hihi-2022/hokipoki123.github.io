      <h2>Identity, Values & Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        An achievement I am proud of is may Bachelor of Arts, Majoring in
        International relations and Minoring in Classics. In high-school, I
        didn’t do so well. Often my grades were scraping by and I was unhappy,
        this resulted in me feeling like I wasn’t smart enough or committed
        enough to achieve things. After a few years of trying different things
        and do bits and pieces I decided to go to university to do what I was
        interested in. University was difficult and scary and yet I enjoyed the
        learning and the environment. I tried to work to a high standard and
        this paid off, I got good grades in the endless onslaught of essays I
        was assigned. All of this proved to myself that I could succeed and
        persist in difficult tasks. This also meant that I goat the magic
        goatskin parchment of proof of learning.

          One time when Jehovahs witnesses came to my door, instead of being
          rude and quickly dismissing them I kindly and slowly told them that my
          view of the world was different and told them to have a nice day.

          Growing up I have been around all sorts of people and some people
          simply are less lucky than others, this made me appreciate the fact
          that not everyone has the same opportunities and thus we should be
          more kind and empathetic.

          My curiosity and creativity will help with me desire to learn and
          create code.

          Sometimes I can be distracted which means in these cases I will have
          to be gentle with myself if I don’t achieve my goals, also I can get
          frustrated which means I may have to be mindful and take breaks
          without guilt.

          A did a group project in university and the tension was about workload
          and fairness. I decided in this case I would reserve any judgement of
          anyone else and just make sure I did not cause any extra work for
          anyone else whilst for filling my parts of the project.
