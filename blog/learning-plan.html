        Learning Plan
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>My long term goal is to be able to enter the workforce in coding, I have friends and family who are doing really well in the sector and I want to join them. </li>
        <li>I would say a strength of mine is commitment, I am really committed to learning new things, especially when they are as important exclusive as dev academy. I do not want to waste this opportunity. My weakness is probably that I can become frustrated and flustered which can impede learning if I donâ€™t vent it.</li>
        <li>I would like to improve my ability to manage stress somewhat, as well improve my ability to focus.  </li>
        <li>Firstly I will try to commit to meeting any expectations placed on me. I am going to try to do this in a timely manner as I will prefer to have weekends as breaks usually. Everyones time here will be limited somewhat so I will endeavour to make the best use of it and learn as much as I can. If things start to build up for me I will have to take breaks, perhaps walk around think of something else for a bit. Otherwise I would talk to someone and vent.        </li>
        <li>I will seek help in a timely way by making sure I am not stuck for more than a smallish amount of time, if I really need help then there is no point in waiting.        </li>
        <li>I expect the facilitation team will help me to stay on the path of learning and help me out when I have an issue.        </li>
        <li>This is not my biggest issue, I am lucky enough to have few obligations at the moment.</li>
      </ol>
