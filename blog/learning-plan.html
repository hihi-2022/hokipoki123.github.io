    <h2>Bootcamp Plan</h2>
    <p>
      One day hopefully after I've gained some skill in coding I
        would like to be able to make use of my BA aswell potentially making
        geopolitical or classical stuff with code. Another weakness I've found is through vivid
        dreams. During foundations many of my dreams feel like endless code which might
        reduce my stamina to code everyday. A non technical challenge would be I
        struggle to talk in front of groups, I'm quite shy so this could be a
        challenge. I am also looking to improve my teamworking
        skills. I expect myself to stay on track and learning
        at the rate expected if possible. Support looks to me like
        non judgemental help or emotional support if I'm upset.
    </p>
    <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        My long term goal is to be able to enter the workforce in coding, I have
        friends and family who are doing really well in the sector and I want to
        join them. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I would say a strength of mine is commitment, I am really committed to
        learning new things, especially when they are as important exclusive as
        dev academy. I do not want to waste this opportunity. My weakness is
        probably that I can become frustrated and flustered which can impede
        learning if I donâ€™t vent it. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I would like to improve my ability to manage stress somewhat, as well
        improve my ability to focus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Firstly I will try to commit to meeting any expectations placed on me. I
        am going to try to do this in a timely manner as I will prefer to have
        weekends as breaks usually. Everyones time here will be limited somewhat
        so I will endeavour to make the best use of it and learn as much as I
        can. If things start to build up for me I will have to take breaks,
        perhaps walk around think of something else for a bit. Otherwise I would
        talk to someone and vent. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I will seek help in a timely way by making sure I am not stuck for more
        than a smallish amount of time, if I really need help then there is no
        point in waiting.
      </li>
      <li>
        I expect the facilitation team will help me to stay on the path of
        learning and help me out when I have an issue. 
      </li>
      <li>
        This is not my biggest issue, I am lucky enough to have few obligations
        at the moment.
      </li>
    </ol>
