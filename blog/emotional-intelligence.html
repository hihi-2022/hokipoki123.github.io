    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Eq is emotional intelligence, it represents ones ability to read their own
      and others emotional states and react appropriately. Eq can also relate to
      ones ability to stay motivated towards something and resist temptation.
      Basically it refers to the ability to understand emotions and natural
      bodily feelings in a logical sense.
    </p>
    <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
    <p>
      Eq is different to Iq because it relates to a different type of
      intelligence. Iq can relate to ones ability to demonstrate intellectual
      feats, it can relate to someones ability to problem solve, their memory,
      math ability, language and even processing speed. Eq is different as it
      relates to ones intelligence with regards to managing their emotions as
      well as others.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>
      Eq is important in a different way to Iq, it helps to reduce conflict and
      to relate and empathise with other members of a group. This trait has no
      doubt been extremely important for our species so far in managing
      differences. Ultimately it is important as we as a social species must
      constantly interact with one another and emotional intelligence is key for
      having these interactions be fulfilling and mutually beneficial.
