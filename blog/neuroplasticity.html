    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity relates to the brains ability to reconstruct and modify
      itself according to the events that happen with it. These events may be an
      injury or could instead be the process of learning a language. Through
      these events the brain can reinforce connections that allow for this
      learning or healing to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because
      people can realise the influence they have over the learning process. This
      can allow someone to feel inspired and also increase their learning
      abilities aswell as their happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I try to engage with principles of neuroplasticity as often as I can, I
      always try to consider something I am trying to learn as an achievable
      process that requires dedication. This already helped me through
      university as I believed in my ability to achieve a goal. This was
      different to highschool where I struggled with a fixed mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity can be to have different
      experiences and consider different perspectives. Anything that challenges
      assumptions can help.
