    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity relates to the brains ability to reconstruct and modify
      itself according to the events that happen with it. These events may be an
      injury or could instead be the process of learning a language. Through
      these events the brain can reinforce connections that allow for this
      learning or healing to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because
      people can realise the influence they have over the learning process. This
      can allow someone to feel inspired and also increase their learning
      abilities aswell as their happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I try to engage with principles of neuroplasticity as often as I can, I
      always try to consider something I am trying to learn as an achievable
      process that requires dedication. This already helped me through
      university as I believed in my ability to achieve a goal. This was
      different to highschool where I struggled with a fixed mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity can be to have different
      experiences and consider different perspectives. Anything that challenges
      assumptions can help.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the following article to be a clear explanation:

    </p>
    <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      A growth mindset is a mindset in which someone is focused on improving
      themselves. Within a growth mindset someone believes that they have the
      ability to learn and improve themselves. They are not affraid of failure,
      rather they see it as something to learn from.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploration was not something entirely new to me, I have known for a
      little while the benefits of self belief and improvement. What it did make
      me think about was my reaction to failure. Sometimes if I stuggle for too
      long at something I can get upset and i should really just be kind to
      myself and have a break instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will encorporate the growth mindset into my journey by simply being
      mindful that Dev academy is a challenge I undertook to improve myself and
      with that I must expect hurdles and some bad days. Ultimately, I will
      focus on improving myself at every point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought the following article describe the growth mindset well:
      https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset
    </p>
    <h2>Influence on my Learning</h2>
    <p>
      These understandings will help my learning plan in the times I am
      struggling as they will help me to keep my perspective as long as I make
      sure to remember my goals.
